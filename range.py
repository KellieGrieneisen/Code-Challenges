"""Given list of numbers, return smallest & largest number as a tuple.

For example::

    >>> find_range([3, 4, 2, 5, 10])
    (2, 10)

    >>> find_range([43, 3, 44, 20, 2, 1, 100])
    (1, 100)

For an empty list, it should return `None` as both smallest and largest::

    >>> find_range([])
    (None, None)

Make sure it works with a list of one item, which is both smallest and
largest::

    >>> find_range([7])
    (7, 7)
